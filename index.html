                  Meet Sojo, a 1993 Mitsubishi Delica imported from Japan.
                  Named Sojourner (Sojo for short) after the first rover on Mars because that's the first thing I thought of when I saw this van.
                  I bought the van with a dream of being a ski bum for the winter and the cheapest way to do that seemed to be to live out of a van.
                  Sojo has a gas-powered 4G64 motor, 5-speed manual transmission, 4x4 high and low, and a max speed of 85mph (downhill &#128517).
                  I picked up Sojo from a Japanese car importer in Michigan on October 24th, 2020 and immediately tore it apart and built it into a camper.
                  Follow along and see a bit of the process in creating the home-on-wheels I lived in for four months!

               <p class="paragraph">
                  The first step was to tear all of the interior out of the rear of the van and restart from scratch.
                  I kicking myself now for not taking a picture before I destroyed something beautiful, but it is what it is.
                  Basically took out the two swivel captain's chairs and bench seat in the back, then removed the carpet floor, all plastic panelling, and the headliner.
                  Had to take everything down to bare bones so I could really build this thing out.

                  I had a lot of ideas cooking in my head for the interor of my camper van.
                  Different layouts, different features, different materials.
                  I had to do a ton of measuring and research to figure out what I could and couldn't fit into the van.
                  Moreover, the biggest challenge was tryig to make the most of the tiny space and pack as much utility as possible while keeping it feeling roomy and aesthetically pleasing.
                  After a ton of measuring, thinking, planning, and quite a few iterations, I finally settled on a rough vision of what I wanted the finished product to look like.

               <a name="Subfloor + Electrical"></a>
               <h2 class="title"><span>Subfloor &amp; Electrical</span></h2>
               <p class="paragraph">
                  The first thing that needed to happen for the interior build was the subfloor.
                  I laid down some insulation and covered it with plywood underlayment.
                  Now, underlayment is not the typical wood to use for a subfloor because it is so thin, meaning it is more flexible and could potentially bend when you walk on it.
                  I used it as my subfloor because I was trying to save as much verical space as possible.
                  To counter the flexibility, I added some wood blocks underneath the underlayment to provide structure down the middle of the van and toward the sliding door, which are the areas with foot traffic.
                  Also pictured on the left is the diesel heater. 
                  With a plan to have this being a livable space during the winter, I needed a heat source to keep things feeling toasty.
                  A diesel parking heater from China seemed to be the perfect solution.
                  Nothing beats watching snow dump outside in the below freezing temps from a 70&degF shelter.
               </p>

               </div>
               <p class="paragraph">
                  Now, in order to run the heater, I needed a power source. 
                  I planned to have a number of things that needed power: the diesel heater; a refrigerator, lights, speakers, outlets, and various other things that needed to be charged.
                  To keep things as simple as possible (and because I hardly knew anything about electrical compenents), I went ahead and got a 1000 watt Jackery portable battery.
                  Not only does this thing have a built-in inverter with 3 AC outlets on the front, it also allowed my to run the DC power into a vuse box.
                  From the fuse box, I snaked wire to the lights, fridge, heater, music, and outlets; all of which run off DC power.
                  The Jackery is charged by the alternator when the van is running and 100 watts of solar on the roof.

               <h2 class="title"><span>Insulation &amp; Interior Build</span></h2>
               <p class="paragraph">
                  To keep the van as warm as possible and retain the heat created by the heater, I needed to insulate the van.
                  I used a combination of materials for the insulation: pink Foamular board to cover the windows, havelock wool for the lower portion of the sides of the van, and Reflectix for the floor, ceiling, and wheel wells.
                  Over the insulation, I framed the van using furring strips.
                  Again, not necessarily the &quot;right&quot; way to do it, but 2x4's would have taken up too much horizontal space.
                  The lower half was framed in later when the walls were put on.
               </p>
               <div class="section_image">
                  <img src="images/Insulation + Framing.jpg" alt="Exposed insulation and framing to be covered by plywood walls." class="image">

                  </div>
               </div>
               <p>
                  The walls are slowly starting to go up while I'm also getting started on the bench&#47bed.
                  I used the same underlayment as the floor for the walls to save space, although I didn&apost really need more than that as the stud provide plenty of rigidity.
                  I also started playing around with stringing my hammock up inside. 
                  Using one of the old seatbelt anchors, I bolted a d-hook on the back of the van to attach one end of the hammock and the passenger grab handle for the other.
                  It worked out perfectly and actually became my favorite way to sleep in the van, especially when the van is not on level ground.

               <p class="paragraph">
                  Finally, the inside of the van is starting to look the part.
                  I finished the bench&#47;bed on the right side of the van.
                  The back of the bench is on a hinge so it can roll over to extend into a bed platform, while the bench seat is used for storage.
                  On the left side, I built a platform to go over the wheel well, house the diesel heater, and serve as additional storage.
                  My refrigerator and sink will later sit on top of this platform.

               <p class="paragraph">
                  The ceiling was one of the more difficult parts of the van build.
                  Mostly because I had to work around the sunroof. 
                  I was also trying to include a slot down the middle that could serve as storage for my wakeboard or snowboard, fishing rods, or other longer items.
                  Using furring strips again and the sunroof assembly as support, I framed up the ceiling and added some insulation.
                  I later sealed up the ceiling with plywood underlayment.

                  I ceiling was covered in a burlap material. In the middle, I included a thin slot which can be used to store things. 
                  I had used it to hold my wakeboard. Lastly, I finished the sunroof and storage slot with dark stained oak.

                  The walls were then covered with the same burlap material used on the ceiling and I put up some poplar slats going the length of the wall.
                  One of my many favorite parts of this van, for both utility and aethetics.
                  These slats not only help elongate the space, but also allowed me to store things on the walls and integrate the LED lighting.
                  You can also see the finished short end of the L-bench here.
                  This area serves as both a seat and additional storage.

                  With the help of a friend (and a lift), I installed a 2&quot; lift kit and larger 31&quot tires for ground clearance and traction.
                  During the winter months out West, it is manditory or have snow rated tires, so this was a must. 
                  These upgrades really helped tie-in the look of the exterior of the van I had envisioned.

                  And here is the finished product! This picture was taken before I added gear and decor.
                  I added a simple sink next to the fridge and finished the floor with patterned cork sealed with polyurethane.
                  Overall pretty stoked on how this thing turned out.
                  Looking back at my original drawing, I feel like it turned out pretty darn close to my vision.
                  There were a bunch of things and design elements I wanted to include, but I wanted to get on the road, so this will be an ongoing project.
                  I the future, I would like to add some sort of storage on the ceiling and possibly more storage at the end of the bench.

                  I lived in this thing for 4 months out West for the winter and logged a total of 70 days snowboarding! 
                  I travelled to resorts in CO, UT, WY, MT, WA, OR, and CA.
                  In Colorado, Winter Park is at the top of my list, but Aspen Snowmass, Copper Mountain, Arapahoe Basin, and Steamboat were incredible.
                  In Utah, Mt. Brighton and Solitude had amazing conditions.
                  Big Sky, Montana was a blast and was the first time I snowboarded true powder up to my waist!
                  Jackson Hole, Wyoming was probably one of my favorite experiences. There was non-stop snow and a hot spring about 10 minutes away from the mountain.
                  In Washington, Crystal Mountain had some great snow and what seemed to be endless runs through the trees.
                  I also loved Mt. Bachelor in Oregon, although I was dissapointed by the lack of fresh snow.
                  California had the best of everything (except gas prices). From Squaw Valley in Tahoe, to Mammoth Mountain where I spent 7 straight days, to LA and Venice Beach, Cali is definitely a dream and a great place to visit.
